Description: Golang library to make HTTP calls with Kerberos authentication
 The package extends Go's HTTP Transport allowing
 Kerberos authentication through Negotiate mechanism (see RFC4559
 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559)).
 .
 Internally it is implemented by wrapping 2 libraries: gokrb5
 (https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5) on Linux and sspi
 (https://github.com/alexbrainman/sspi) on Windows.
 .
 There is no pre-authenticaion yet, so the library assumes you have
 Kerberos ticket obtained.
 .
 Linux implementation requires MIT or Heimdal Kerberos to be
 present. Windows implementation utilizes credentials of currently logged
 in user.
 .
 Currently it allows only to make HTTP calls, no server side support yet.
